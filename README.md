# HCI Study 2016

This is a simple repo for my private reading from Oberlin College for the
Fall of 2016, doing research for the creation of a paper
to be submitted to the CHI student research competition in January 2017.

TODO (e.g. questions for 12/08/16)
----

- R Sweave is being finicky :/ I think it's a path thing?
- Okay, what ARE summary statistics? Because I'm really at a loss as to how to
read through the R `summary` output
