# HCI Study 2016

This is a simple repo for my private reading from Oberlin College for the
Fall of 2016, doing research for the creation of a paper
to be submitted to the CHI student research competition in January 2017.

TODO (e.g. questions for 12/15/16)
----

- can we look at the Qualtrics data, how should I go through and verify answers and stuff?
- what tests should I run once I know the threshold for a valid answer (and confirm our 56 instances adhere to that)?
    - maybe the R In A Nutshell, also including statistics, will tell me and I can just read through some more of it
on my way home?
